                   <h3><b>STUDY PURPOSE</b></h3>
                   <p>
                    The purpose of this study is to better understand how we make decisions about stimuli we see.
                    In this experiment, you will see a series of cards of different colours and shapes.
                   </p>
                  <h3><b>Foreseeable risks or discomforts</b></h3>
                  <p>
                   The risks and discomforts associated with this study are minimal.
                 </p>
                 <h3><b>CONFIDENTIALITY</b></h3>
                 <p>
                   All information related to personal identity will remain confidential and all answers will be stored on a protected computer server.
                   Once a participant has been compensated, their Prolific account number will be stripped from the dataset.
                   At this point, the researcher will have no way to link an Prolific account number to the participant identity.
                   Withdrawal from the study will not be possible after this point.
                   Results will be disseminated at conferences and journals only as group ratings.
                 </p>
                 <h3><b>COMPENSATION</b></h3>
                 <p>
                   If you choose to participate in the study, it will take about 30-45 minutes to complete, you will be compensated up to $6.00 through your Prolific account, <b>depending on your choices during the experiment</b>.
                   <br><br>
                   <b>**Your participation in this study is completely voluntary.**</b>
                   <br><br>
                   You can refuse to make a response, at any time, can quit the study without any penalty.
                 </p>
