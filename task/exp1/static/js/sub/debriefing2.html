                <p>Thank you for your participation in our study!  Your anonymous data makes an
        important contribution to our understanding of cognitive effort. </p>

        <p>The purpose of this study was to invesigate how progress contributes to
       how people view cognitive effort. Cognitive effort is usually thought of as
       the amount of mental energy needed to accomplish some task. Generally speaking,
       effort is usually thought of as aversive -- people tend to avoid spending it in most
       day-to-day tasks. However, we still use effort all the time because it usually confers some benefit.
       For example, we may spend a lot of mental effort studying for an exam, because doing so will secure us
      a good grade. </p>

    <p>In this study, we hypothesized that one such case where people will invest effort is when they are close to a goal. That is, we hypothesized that when people are closer to a goal (here, the points), they would work mentally harder, which would be captured in their behaviour while responding to the words/colours. </p>

        <p>If you have any questions about this research, you may contact the
        principal investigator, Sean Devine (seandamiandevine@gmail.com).</p>
